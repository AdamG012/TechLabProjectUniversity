"The ICT Techlab|The increased collaboration and accelerating rates of disruption introduce challenges and opportunities to the University's core strategies of research and education. In this website, we examine some of the latest trends of significance to the University, outlining their impact and providing suggestions on how to best proceed with them. It is designed to help us understand the horizon of trends from each field?s perspective. The trends listed here are not linear in nature, and their concepts will continually change. Some trends are imminent and should be addressed immediately, while others are emerging and may not impact the University for some time. Where a decision to proceed is made for any listed trend, our suggestions outline some potential activities we can undertake within the innovation framework. As we and other organisations experiment within these trends, new opportunities may arise and these suggestions may change to reflect this.|placeholder"
