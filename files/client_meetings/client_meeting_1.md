# Client Meeting Week 1

## Summary & Takeaways

This meeting primarily consisted of an introduction to the project, team members and infrastructure while also laying the groundwork for designing the scope for next week's meeting. The design of the current platform was explained and goals for the project were outlined. This consisted of:

- The category / search criteria was not easy to use and not detailed.
